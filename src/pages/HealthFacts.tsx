    fact: "Sharp pain travels at about 20 m/s, but slow throbbing pain crawls along C-fibres at just 0.5–2 m/s. That's why you feel a sharp sting first, then the dull ache arrives a second later — they're literally different signals on different fibres.",

    hook: "You are literally paralysed every night — on purpose",
    fact: "During REM sleep, your brainstem actively sends signals to paralyse your voluntary muscles. This is called REM atonia and it stops you acting out your dreams. People with REM sleep behaviour disorder lack this mechanism and physically punch, kick and shout in their sleep.",
    mindBlown: "Your brain during REM sleep shows electrical activity almost identical to when you are wide awake — the only reliable difference is the paralysis signal.",

    fact: "Aerobic exercise triggers the release of BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which stimulates neurogenesis — the birth of brand new neurons — primarily in the hippocampus, the region responsible for memory and learning.",
    mindBlown: "Just 20 minutes of moderate exercise produces measurable improvements in memory and problem-solving for 2–3 hours afterward. It's more reliably effective than most nootropic supplements.",

    hook: "Swearing actually reduces pain — scientifically proven",
    fact: "A 2009 study at Keele University found that participants who swore while holding their hand in ice-cold water could endure the pain significantly longer than those who repeated a neutral word. Swearing triggers an emotional response that activates the body's fight-or-flight pain-dampening system.",
    mindBlown: "However, people who swear habitually get less pain relief from it — the effect diminishes with overuse, just like a drug tolerance.",

    fact: "Humans share approximately 60% of their genes with bananas, 85% with mice, and 98.8% with chimpanzees. The genes we share with bananas are largely the ones responsible for basic cellular machinery — like how cells divide and produce energy.",
    mindBlown: "Two unrelated humans share 99.9% of their DNA. The entire genetic difference between any two people on Earth fits into about 3 million base pairs — out of 3 billion.",

    hook: "You can smell about 1 trillion different odours",
    fact: "A 2014 study in Science found humans can discriminate at least 1 trillion distinct smells — far exceeding the previously assumed 10,000. Your olfactory system has around 400 types of smell receptors that combine like a code to identify virtually unlimited combinations.",
    mindBlown: "Smell is the only sense that bypasses the thalamus and connects directly to the amygdala and hippocampus — which is why a smell can trigger a vivid memory or strong emotion almost instantaneously.",

    hook: "Fake surgery works just as well as real surgery — for some conditions",
    fact: "Multiple randomised controlled trials have found that sham knee surgery (where surgeons make incisions but do nothing) produces the same pain relief and functional improvement as actual arthroscopic surgery for osteoarthritis — even two years later.",
    mindBlown: "The placebo effect works even when patients are told they're taking a placebo. This 'open-label placebo' still reduces IBS symptoms and chronic back pain — the brain doesn't need to be deceived to respond.",

    emoji: "🩸",
    hook: "Red blood cells have no nucleus — and live only 120 days",
    fact: "Mature red blood cells eject their nucleus during development to maximise space for haemoglobin. This means they can carry ~270 million haemoglobin molecules per cell — but it also means they cannot repair themselves, so they die after ~120 days and are replaced.",
    mindBlown: "Your bone marrow produces about 2 million new red blood cells every second to keep up with the die-off. In one day, you make roughly 200 billion new red blood cells.",

    fact: "A landmark 2020 Stanford study analysed 677,000 temperature measurements and found the average human body temperature has been declining since the 1800s — and now sits closer to 36.6°C. The original 37°C was measured in a Prussian study in 1851 on a population that was chronically inflamed from widespread infections.",
    mindBlown: "Researchers believe our lower temperatures today reflect reduced systemic inflammation — a result of modern medicine eliminating chronic bacterial infections that kept our immune systems perpetually activated.",

    hook: "Bacteria in your gut talk directly to your brain — via a nerve highway",
    fact: "The vagus nerve acts as a direct two-way communication cable between your gut and brain. Gut bacteria produce neurotransmitters (including GABA and serotonin precursors) that travel up this nerve and influence mood, anxiety, and even decision-making.",
    mindBlown: "Germ-free mice (raised with no gut bacteria) show dramatically higher anxiety and stress responses. When given normal gut bacteria, their behaviour normalises — suggesting gut flora actively shape personality-level traits.",
